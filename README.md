**Neural Networks and Deep learning** - Course 1 of The deeplearning specialization at *Deeplearning.ai*

This is very useful course to get a hang of neural networks and how they really work from within.

Andrew is a good teacher, and you get to learn by implementing a lot of the underlying maths into python in this course.

Here is a small description of the backpropagation which was very useful when I had to to implement it from scratch in one of the course assignments.
